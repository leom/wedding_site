                <p>The best gift anyone could give is celebrating with us on our special day.</p>

                <p>However, we know that some would like to give us a gift to commemorate our wedding and we would be grateful for anything received. However, we do know that some of you would appreciate some ideas and for this reason we have set up a small wedding list with John Lewis.</p>

                <p>Items from the gift list can be purchased online, which will be delivered to us after the ceremony. If you prefer to have an item to wrap and decorate items can also be purchased in store; we ask you please quote gift ID #538988 when doing so.</p>
